# SwarmUI-MobileUIExtension

SwarmUI Mobile UI extension is aimed to bring the ability to use SwarmUI on smartphones - fixes of some annoying bugs, better elements' sizes and positions etc. Tested in [Android Firefox Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox).

## How to install

1. In the folder where SwarmUI is installed:
* `cd src/Extensions`
* `git clone https://github.com/Eugeniusz-Gienek/SwarmUI-MobileUIExtension.git`

Afterwards, either 2a or 2b:

2a. In Web Interface
* Click "Update and restart server" button in the "Server" tab in "Server info" subsection"

2b. Still in console, in SwarmUI folder run `./launch-linux-dev.sh` (or `launch-windows-dev.ps1` I guess if using Windows, though can't check this as I don't use it)

3. That's it.
